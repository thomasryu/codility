/*

You are given integers K, M and a non-empty array A consisting of N integers.
Every element of the array is not greater than M.

You should divide this array into K blocks of consecutive elements.
The size of the block is any integer between 0 and N. Every element of the array should belong to some block.

The sum of the block from X to Y equals A[X] + A[X + 1] + ... + A[Y]. The sum of empty block equals 0.
The large sum is the maximal sum of any block.

For example, you are given integers K = 3, M = 5 and array A such that:
  A[0] = 2
  A[1] = 1
  A[2] = 5
  A[3] = 1
  A[4] = 2
  A[5] = 2
  A[6] = 2

The array can be divided, for example, into the following blocks:
- [2, 1, 5, 1, 2, 2, 2], [], [] with a large sum of 15;
- [2], [1, 5, 1, 2], [2, 2] with a large sum of 9;
- [2, 1, 5], [], [1, 2, 2, 2] with a large sum of 8;
- [2, 1], [5, 1], [2, 2, 2] with a large sum of 6.

The goal is to minimize the large sum. In the above example, 6 is the minimal large sum.

Write a function:
  function solution(K, M, A);

that, given integers K, M and a non-empty array A consisting of N integers, returns the minimal large sum.

For example, given K = 3, M = 5 and array A such that:
  A[0] = 2
  A[1] = 1
  A[2] = 5
  A[3] = 1
  A[4] = 2
  A[5] = 2
  A[6] = 2

the function should return 6, as explained above.

Write an efficient algorithm for the following assumptions:
- N and K are integers within the range [1..100,000];
- M is an integer within the range [0..10,000];
- each element of array A is an integer within the range [0..M].

  // The goal here is to check if we can squeeze the result in blocks of lower size

  // Note that, the more evenly we distribute the blocks (i.e., the lower the size of each non-empty block),
  // the lower large sum is

    let mid = Math.floor((start + end) / 2)

      end = mid - 1

      start = mid + 1
